# Article:
The article I picked is: http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html

## Summary:
I find this article interesting because it changed my perspective on engineering. Previously I thought of my work as a software engineer as siloed and product focused, however Paul Graham writes about the importance of "hacking", and how applying creativity to your work as a developer is very important. I also find Paul Graham (founder of YC) as a person quite interesting so I enjoy reading his essays.

## Aditya - Additional Comments
It was interesting to see how he was able to tie both sides of the word "hacking" together. I was intrigued by how he connected hacking into a broader sense of life, such as when he connecting it to the Founding Fathers of the United States.
